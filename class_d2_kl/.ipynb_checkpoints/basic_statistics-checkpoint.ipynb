    "A module is a Python file containing Python statements and definitions. For example, a file evenodd.py is a module, and we call it ‘evenodd’. We put similar code together in one module. This helps us modularize our code, and make it much easier to deal with. And not only that, a module grants us reusability. With a module, we don’t need to write the same code again for a new project that we take up.\n",

    "* SciPy is a set of open source (BSD licensed) scientific and numerical tools for Python. It currently supports special functions, integration, ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, gradient optimization, parallel programming tools, an expression-to-C++ compiler for fast execution, and others. A good rule of thumb is that if it’s covered in a general textbook on numerical computing (for example, the well-known Numerical Recipes series), it’s probably implemented in SciPy."

As such, measures of central tendency are sometimes called measures of central location. They are also classed as summary statistics.
