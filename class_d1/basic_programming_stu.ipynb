    "* Variables allow us to name our data in ways that make it easier to understand and use in code, and provides the **freedom of choice** in regard to variable names.\n",
    "* Variables are **reserved allocations** in memory that can hold defined values. \n",
    "* Variables have three main operations: **create**, **input**, and **retrieve**. \n",
    "* A useful analogy for understanding the relationship between variables and values is an **envelope** and a **letter**: the envelope is the variable, and the value is the letter, or contents. calling a variable is like opening an envelope and withdrawing the contents.\n",
    "* An advantage of storing data as variables is that they can be referred to by **name** in later parts of the code.\n",
    "* To create a variable, **declare** it. \n",
    "* To put a value in a variable, **assign** it. \n",
    "* To retrieve a variable, **call** it. \n",

    "In this scenario, **score** is a variable that represents an ever-changing numeric number. We can track two scores in two different variables: **team_a_score** and **team_b_score**. Whenever Team A gets a point, the **team_a_score** variable should be incremented by 1. The same goes for Team B. At any moment, the two scores can be compared to find out who is winning.\n",
    "There are advantages to tracking performance or ranking in a game as **score**. First, it increases flexibility. We can reference **score** without specifying if its the score of a baseball game, video game, or even an exam. Regardless of context, **score** has a value, and that value has meaning. **score** as a word and concept is also easy to remember, and its significance is stored in people's mind (memory). **score** can be referenced in conversation, and others will understand its representation. This makes **score** a great example of a variable.\""
