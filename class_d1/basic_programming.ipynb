    "In this scenario, **score** is a variable that represents an ever-changing numeric number. We can track two scores in two different variables: **team_a_score** and **team_b_score**. Whenever Team A gets a point, the **team_a_score** variable should be incremented by 1. The same goes for Team B. At any moment, the two scores can be compared to find out who is winning.\n",
    "There are advantages to tracking performance or ranking in a game as **score**. First, it increases flexibility. We can reference **score** without specifying if its the score of a baseball game, video game, or even an exam. Regardless of context, **score** has a value, and that value has meaning. **score** as a word and concept is also easy to remember, and its significance is stored in people's mind (memory). **score** can be referenced in conversation, and others will understand its representation. This makes **score** a great example of a variable.\"\n",
